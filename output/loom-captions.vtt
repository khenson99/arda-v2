00:00:00.011 --> 00:00:04.542
<v 0>Hey guys, I just wanted to roll through some feedback on the front end.</v>

2
00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:08.454
So, a couple of things. So, I've noticed the quick actions here,

3
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:10.947
it wraps, whereas the others don't.

4
00:00:10.947 --> 00:00:13.607
So, for instance, image URL is cut off, or image,

5
00:00:13.607 --> 00:00:16.016
I guess, yeah, it's cut off there. But, quick actions here.

6
00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.711
So, quick for some reason wraps. It would be great if they could all

7
00:00:17.711 --> 00:00:20.692
wrap, and you could always read the words that are being said.

8
00:00:20.997 --> 00:00:24.032
Also, there's no real indication of a column shift,

9
00:00:24.032 --> 00:00:26.544
so it's really hard to adjust width.

10
00:00:28.256 --> 00:00:31.750
Some frequently end up just dragging them around. And it's also hard because it's

11
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:34.297
really not intuitive how long each one is,

12
00:00:34.297 --> 00:00:37.991
and also there's clearly some padding or buffer space between the text and the

13
00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:40.213
end, because skew's getting cut off here,

14
00:00:40.213 --> 00:00:43.054
but I don't, it doesn't feel like it should, based on where the mouse

15
00:00:43.054 --> 00:00:46.663
is. And then additionally, these are the fields that should be visible,

16
00:00:46.757 --> 00:00:49.066
in this order. things like,

17
00:00:49.077 --> 00:00:51.784
created, should not be visible and take up a ton of space,

18
00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:55.030
like, right in kind of the prime real estate area.

19
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.710
So, yeah, hopefully, hopefully, getting this,

20
00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:01.111
this helps. additionally, inline editing is not obvious at all,

21
00:01:01.122 --> 00:01:04.239
and so, like, there's nothing that really tells me that I should be able

22
00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.398
to edit that, and then, for instance,

23
00:01:06.398 --> 00:01:09.719
like, that interaction with the sidebar coming out is pretty tough,

24
00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:14.025
and then it's also impossible to edit any of the dropdowns because the sidebar

25
00:01:14.025 --> 00:01:17.266
comes out when you double-click, so you never actually get a chance to do

26
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.276
that. Oh, actually, that was the first time I succeeded.

27
00:01:19.626 --> 00:01:23.640
That's cool. and it's also separately a little bit confusing that they're all caps

28
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.852
when they render here, but, lowercase here,

29
00:01:25.862 --> 00:01:28.010
would be great if they could just be kind of, like, lowercase, normal,

30
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.861
human, readable, that would be, I think, a bit less confusing,

31
00:01:30.872 --> 00:01:33.089
and then one other thing that is definitely,

32
00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:35.695
vexed, I just, I got an email about this, which started the whole you

33
00:01:35.807 --> 00:01:38.354
me poking at the front end, is, item type, item subtype,

34
00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:43.540
these look like they should show up next time

35
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.856
I type something, and they don't.

36
00:01:47.856 --> 00:01:52.453
And

37
00:01:52.453 --> 00:01:57.049
so,

38
00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.045
regardless of, yeah, where I make the edits or,

39
00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:02.330
or anything, which item it's on,

40
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:04.521
they, yeah, it just doesn't, does not show up.

41
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:08.053
So, that's, that's kind of a confusing interaction. love the density.

42
00:02:08.053 --> 00:02:10.595
The density is amazing. That really, really helps.

43
00:02:10.606 --> 00:02:13.914
yeah, for sure. and then, further, some of these words are just confusing.

44
00:02:14.077 --> 00:02:16.682
So, I think order quantity, and order units,

45
00:02:16.682 --> 00:02:19.987
plural, would be a bit better. And then if it's just minQuantity and minUnits,

46
00:02:19.998 --> 00:02:22.311
that would be better. and then, for,

47
00:02:22.322 --> 00:02:25.574
what was it, oh yeah, this, kind of cuts off here.

48
00:02:25.585 --> 00:02:28.144
the, the grid lines, and I think there's a ticket for that,

49
00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:30.212
and then also the buttons don't really have, like,

50
00:02:30.222 --> 00:02:32.802
hover, or, like, focus states, and so,

51
00:02:32.813 --> 00:02:35.148
I actually, looked at the, mockups,

52
00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.005
and here they, they have this, it's kind of confusing, because there's two different,

53
00:02:38.016 --> 00:02:42.045
paradigms here, but, this turns to a slightly different color when your mouse is

54
00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:44.166
over it, and this brings up a, a tool tip,

55
00:02:44.177 --> 00:02:46.330
both of which I think could be, could be great,

56
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:48.824
and simple, they would also be great if there was feedback when you did

57
00:02:48.824 --> 00:02:50.930
click one of the buttons, so, like, you,

58
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.041
I clicked print, very unclear if anything happened,

59
00:02:54.267 --> 00:02:56.339
okay, so it did print, so, that would be,

60
00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.689
yeah, that'd be super useful, and then, wait,

61
00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:06.325
oops, so,

62
00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:09.558
for the cards, this has a card, it doesn't look like it does,

63
00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:13.363
so, for instance, this is showing up as zero cards,

64
00:03:14.224 --> 00:03:16.560
that the item has, I think, or it could just be zero in the

65
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.086
cart. Anyway,

66
00:03:19.086 --> 00:03:21.148
maybe that's what it is. And then,

67
00:03:22.148 --> 00:03:25.015
now I've added it to the cart. So if it has a card,

68
00:03:25.794 --> 00:03:28.186
it's very unclear why I can't add it to the cart.

69
00:03:29.186 --> 00:03:32.117
Okay,

70
00:03:32.117 --> 00:03:35.182
so now that's one on the cart. Okay, so now I can add the

71
00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:38.518
second card to the cart. But that's still saying one,

72
00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:43.710
but it did get greyed out. And then this doesn't have,

73
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.053
a card, seemingly. but,

74
00:03:46.556 --> 00:03:50.868
it clearly does. And this one is waiting to be received,

75
00:03:50.868 --> 00:03:53.064
I guess, or waiting to be, I know,

76
00:03:53.064 --> 00:03:55.493
this is available. Yeah, so I can't click this button,

77
00:03:55.538 --> 00:03:58.079
I guess, because it's available. Well, okay, that one I can't click,

78
00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:08.159
because it's in the card, so let me just It'd

79
00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:22.590
be great

80
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.968
if I could just edit the item from here without having to click that

81
00:04:24.968 --> 00:04:25.501
dropdown.

82
00:04:41.506 --> 00:04:45.402
That's strange. So it says email persisted,

83
00:04:45.402 --> 00:04:48.016
but it's still showing up here as online, and so I can't.

84
00:04:49.016 --> 00:04:52.270
Huh, that was odd. okay, let me just receive these.

85
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.174
Okay,

86
00:04:55.174 --> 00:04:58.007
great. Okay, so now, now these are working.

87
00:04:58.588 --> 00:05:01.685
Except this one's still not. So,

88
00:05:02.063 --> 00:05:09.627
I guess do I have to go through? Okay,

89
00:05:09.627 --> 00:05:11.567
yeah, so I guess I had to go through it once in order for

90
00:05:11.567 --> 00:05:16.198
it to be addable. So, it would be good to get that sorted.

91
00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:19.030
and then, lastly. The thing is this GL code. this does not,

92
00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:22.182
like, you can't get rid of it. And it shows up initially on the

93
00:05:22.182 --> 00:05:24.372
left, and takes up a lot of really good real estate, and,

94
00:05:24.382 --> 00:05:26.462
yeah, given that you can't get rid of it, it's pretty, pretty tough.

95
00:05:26.462 --> 00:05:30.608
Also pretty tough that, these Thank much. don't readjust based on the,

96
00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:32.708
order that, the item,

97
00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:35.395
like, the fields are actually in. I think we talked about that one.

98
00:05:35.406 --> 00:05:39.931
and, oh, and saving is really counterintuitive in a menu like this.

99
00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:44.466
Typically, you just want to have your name or selections persist with,

100
00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:46.826
like, when you click out of this. so, like, I just click here for

101
00:05:46.826 --> 00:05:48.885
it to go away, like, it does, which is good. but,

102
00:05:50.205 --> 00:05:54.251
I would expect the changes that I made there to persist without clicking save.

103
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:56.547
And then, finally,

104
00:05:56.547 --> 00:05:58.791
I was doing a demo of the,

105
00:05:58.801 --> 00:06:01.360
onboarding tool, and I,

106
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.460
I added, like, 2,000 items, I thought it was 200,

107
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:06.141
and so, I had to go through and delete them all, and it's just,

108
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:09.206
pretty much, it be tough to only be able to do 28 at a

109
00:06:09.206 --> 00:06:12.057
time, and have no, like, pagination, even if it does have to be,

110
00:06:12.057 --> 00:06:14.071
like, no lazy load, where you, you know,

111
00:06:14.071 --> 00:06:17.083
you just scroll and, and then things load, it would be really great to

112
00:06:17.083 --> 00:06:19.764
be able to select, like, paid, like, you know, number of entries,

113
00:06:19.764 --> 00:06:24.108
100, that would definitely save me a lot of time from doing this.

114
00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:26.480
cool, but, awesome work, these updates are really huge,

115
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.054
but, I think there's like, yeah, some confusion about what the default order should

116
00:06:29.054 --> 00:06:31.186
be, so I just wanted to clarify,

117
00:06:31.196 --> 00:06:31.537
some of that.
